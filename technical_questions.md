1)
I spent 3h44 on the code part, and another 10mn on the Unit Tests.

2) 
First I would add the UI testing part.
Then I would add an empty view on the main collectionview if needed
I woud also add more details to the items displayed, maybe order them in category. 

Also, some fancy stuff like an icon, a splash screen and some credits 


Also, as a matter of fact, I think that a good code is a code that is self, explanatory, no needs for extra comments when it's not needed. So in this project I chose not to include comments in my files.
